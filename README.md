## 📖 About The Project

Cineora is an AI-powered Movie Recommendation System that helps users discover movies similar to their favorite films.

The application leverages the **TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset** along with a Machine Learning recommendation engine based on **Content-Based Filtering** and **Cosine Similarity** to generate personalized movie suggestions.

The platform combines a modern React frontend, a Node.js backend, and a Flask-based ML service to deliver fast and accurate recommendations with movie posters and metadata.

## 🚀 Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prateek-Dhar-Dwivedi/Movie_Recommender_System_Cineora_Frontend.git
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### ML Service Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User enters a movie title.
2. React frontend sends a request to the backend.
3. Backend communicates with the Flask ML service.
4. The ML model computes similarity scores.
5. Recommended movies are returned.
6. Posters and movie information are displayed to the user.
